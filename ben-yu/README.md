# Script description
Week 1 and 2 was early data exploration. Other scripts and not books relate to RoBERTa and DistilBERT training.

# Running
For RoBERTa and DistilBRERT training, its recommended that you run it in Google Colab due to GPU constraints. For other scripts, they can be run locally with the conda environment

# Data

Ensure the correct dataset is loaded. Please reach out to Dr. Alexander for an updated dataset. If you run some of the earlier scripts on the new anonymized data, you may need to update the paths or the column name. This was due to needing to re-anonymize the data.
